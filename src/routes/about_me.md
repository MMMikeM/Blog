# Some stuff about me / thoughts I have

- I have an unhealthy relationship with optimisation - you know when you optimise for an event that'll never happen? 🚤
- Definitely a dog person 🐕
- True mechanical keyboard endgame is split low profile and something like colemak ⌨️
- I'm an advocate for simplicity as far as possible 👍
- I am currently a senior frontend developer at DVT, but making my way downtown to the fullstack life 🥞
- React is good, Nextjs is great. Preact might be better (outside of how it handles complicated types), Solid is definitely better. But right now I'm enjoying Sveltekit - it feels around the maturity of Preact (less than Vue), but with some super niceties that you'd find in NextJs 🤷‍♂️
- I prefer tailwindcss to css-in-js or styled components. But I want to support Windicss because they're driving incredible innovation - also Unocss which is gonna be 🐐
- Also, I like emojis
