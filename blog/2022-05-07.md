# I had a great week this week
This week, I managed to work on quite a bit in my spare time. 

### Timesheets
I did some work in Pyautogui to automate my timesheet capturing. Generally, I need to go to a page, log in, select the same template that I use every week, submit, take a screenshot, and email the screenshot via gmail. I couldn't get selenium to use the same browser window unfortunately, so the 2FA is blocking me, but I plan to automate this process a bit more. For now, I am just targeting certain mouse positions to click, and that's getting the result I want (up to the email, I need to automate that too). Getting there.

### Email reader
I had some code lying around from a year ago that I managed to destroy. I finally had the time (and guts) to sit down and look at it again. I struggled with it a bit as the documentation for imapclient didn't cover what I needed, but ultimately, I got the result I wanted. I can now extract all emails based on search conditions and put the body, subject, date etc. into a dataframe. The reason why this is especially useful to me, is that I have been sending myself emails over the past few years as reminders of movies to watch, recipes to try, places to visit, names to remember. Now I can finally put these into a Notion page and reduce my inbox count.

### OFC data
This went better than I imagined. I am working on a study with Bianca regarding the air pollution in South Africa. I generated Chloropleths using Average data but had to revert to yearly data. This introduced a few complications - one of them was when plotting a map, I had 2 colours; red: non-compliant, blue: compliant. If the map had no compliant values, it would make the non-compliant blue. I had to explicitly state this, and couldn't find much documentation on this, I figured it out eventually, and iterated through the df and saved figures to the relevant folders. All of that is now in Notion, hosted by a [public github repo](https://cerulean-sheet-8e2.notion.site/OFC-study-results-41d21b1519a14989b81d2d66d7577abc) (most of my repos are private due to the nature of the data that I am working with).

### JPI
Similar to the timesheets, I had to go to an outdated application that uses Lotus Notes to request document numbers. I had to do quite a few drawings, and in the future I will need to do it again for the next revision. I wrote some code that worked on mouse positions again (which admittedly, is not robust, but its quick to implement). I ran the code and I went to make lunch. By the time I was back, it was done.    

### Learning
I did some general learning on Machine Learning, working through a course called "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp". I'm 78 of 166 modules in. The first half was dedicated to Python in general but now I am getting into the Machine Learning part and I am excited!!
